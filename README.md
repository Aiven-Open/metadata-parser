Aiven Metadata Parser
========================

Want to get all the juicy metadata out of your Aiven services? Check the Aiven Metadata Parser! 

Based on the `aiven-client` python library, the Aiven Metadata Parser exports the metadata from your services in order to build a connected graph showing all interconnections.

Currently the Aiven Metadata Parser is work in progress and extracts only a limited amount of information and connections

Create a set of test services
=============================

You can use the `create_services.sh` and `delete_services.sh` to create and destroy a pre-set of services.
The `create_services.sh` uses:

* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to parse JSON output
* [kcat](https://github.com/edenhill/kcat) for Apache Kafka®
* [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) for PostgreSQL®
* [The Aiven CLI](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client) to connect and create services
* The Python packages in the `requirements.txt` file to push data to Grafana

Before starting it, please install the required dependences, login with the [Aiven CLI](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client) and execute

```bash
./scripts/create_services.sh <PROJECT_NAME>
```

Where `<PROJECT_NAME>` is the name of your Aiven project

To delete the services you can call

```bash
./scripts/delete_services.sh <PROJECT_NAME>
```

If `<PROJECT_NAME>` is not passed, the default project will be used

Start with the Aiven Metadata Parser
=======================================

You need to be on Python 3.7, install the required libraries with

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy the `conf.env.sample` file to `conf.env` in the `conf` folder and edit the token parameter and the project name from which you want to extract parameters.
If you don't have a project with services already running you can create a sample set of services with the `create_services.sh` file, which requires the `aiven-client` to be installed and the user to be logged.

Once `conf.env` is set, you can start the metadata extraction with 

```bash
python main.py
```

This will generate:
* A file `graph_data.dot` containing the information in [DOT format](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html)
* A file `graph_data.gml` containing the information in [GML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language)
* A file `nx.html` containing the complete interactive graph
![Graph in action](img/graph.gif)
* (Disabled for the moment) A file `filtered.html` containing the complete interactive graph filtered on the node with id `pg~demo-pg~schema~public~table~pasta` (this might error out if you don't have such node)

Furthermore if, after executing the `main.py` you also execute the following

```bash
python app.py
```

The `app.py` reads the `graph_data.gml` file generated at step 1 and creates a Reactive Web Applications with [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) and [Dash](https://plot.ly/dash/) (code taken from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-interactive-network-visualization-using-networkx-plotly-and-dash-e44749161ed7))

**Warning** 
The code is a bare minimum product, doesn't cover all services and options and is quite chaotic! it demonstrates the idea and how we could start implementing it.

Possible issues and solutions
============

- If you run `python app.py` and see an error saying `No such file or directory: 'neato'`, you will have to install `graphviz` on your machine (the package version from pip doesn't seem to work) - check how to install [here](https://graphviz.org/download/)
